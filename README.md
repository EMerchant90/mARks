# mARks

A map application that will utilize Augmented Reality to help users find points of interest.

There are two types of ways to find new areas of interest:

1.The 2D map has a place for a user to drop a pin at any location desired. Once pin is dropped 28 images that were taken in that area are presented. This helps shows the user what the area looks like.

2.The AR map finds landmarks in the surrounding area and shows how far they are in Augmented Reality. The marker displays which direction the point of interest is and how far.

#Technologies

ARKit was used for the Augmented Reality screen. 
Alamofire and Alamofire images were used as frameworks to implement the images into the app.
